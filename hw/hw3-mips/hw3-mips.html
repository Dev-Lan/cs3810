<h1>Homework 3: MIPS Assembly</h1>

<p>This assignment will teach you to write simple MIPS assembly programs. 
We will be using <a href="https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/">SPIM simulator</a>, a 
small simulator that implements the MIPS architecture we covered in class. 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private github/gitlab repo, however any public release is prohibited. 


<h2>Install SPIM</h2>

<p>
As the first step of this homework install SPIM simulator. Visit <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/">
	download SPIM</a> and choose the most recent version for the operating systme you're running. 

<p>While SPIM is pretty much intuitive and self-explanatory, you might want to watch a short 
introduction video that expains how to use it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlssbwmPfnc">How to Program in MIPS! (QTSpim) (Beginner)</a>

<p>You can use any editor to develop MIPS code (after all to run it in SPIM you will simply open a file), but I 
recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as it is simple, runs on all platforms, and supports
MIPS syntax with a plugin. 

<h2>Count set bits from 0 to N</h2>

Now you're ready to work on the homework itself. Your assignment is to implement a MIPS program that counts all set bits (the ones 
that are 1) in numbers from 1 to N (including N). Specifically, your program asks a user to input an integer number and then outputs a number of set bits. For example, 
if the user enters 5, then if you look at binary representation of all the numbers from 0 to 5 and their bits:

<pre>0b0 0b1 0b10 0b11 0b100 0b101 </pre>

The sum of all set bits is 7. 




<h2>Submit your work</h2>

<b>What to submit</b>: just submit your code as a single <pre>.asm</pre> file on <a
 href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/418795/assignments/2298517">Gradescope</a>. 
You can resubmit as many times as you wish up until the deadline.
